### Practice Activity #7 - Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection with Java Code     

  Note: In this practice activity, do not use component scanning.

1. Create a new Coach implementation.   

2. Create a new fortune service implementation (return a single hard-coded fortune)

3. Create a Java configuration class to perform IoC and DI with those classes.

4. Develop a main application to retrieve your coach implementation.   

5. Test your application and verify your coach implementation is wired up as desired.
