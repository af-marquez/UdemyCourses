## Practice Activity #5 - Dependency Injection with Annotations     

1. Define a new implementation for the FortuneService.

  - Your fortune service should read the fortunes from a file.   

  - The fortune service should load the fortunes into an array   

  - When the getFortune() method is called it would return a random fortune from the array.   

2. Inject your new dependency into your Coach implementation

3. Test your application to verify you are getting random fortunes based on your fortunes file.
