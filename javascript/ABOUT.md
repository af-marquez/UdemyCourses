# About this course:
# The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!

### _The #1 bestselling JavaScript course on Udemy!_


> "Really, really well made course. Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify your Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn't skip over anything that might be useful to a JS developer" 

â€” Carson Bartholomew

This is the most complete and in-depth JavaScript course on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet!). It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.

You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through __practical and fun code examples, important theory__ about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and complete projects.

You will become ready to continue learning advanced front-end frameworks like __React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte__.

You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need on your developer job.

And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so __you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript from the ground up!__

But... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's "The Complete JavaScript Course". In fact, it's like many courses in one! But __you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course.__ That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.

_By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer._
